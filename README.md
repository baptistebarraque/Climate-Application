# Climate and Vegetation Data Interface & Prediction Model

This project, developed for the **900M association**, aims to create an interface providing climate and vegetation data while identifying correlations between them. Additionally, it includes a predictive model designed to simulate soil moisture evolution following rainfall events for different locations.

## Project Structure

- `Interface/` : Contains the application displaying different kind of data, and houses the predictive interface allowing the user to predict the moisture of the soil for a choosen location  at d+3
- `prediction_model/` : Houses the Notebooks that have been used to work and benchmark the differents models and hyperparameters.

## Future Developments

- Enhance prediction accuracy by refining the models.
- Optimize some functionalities.
- Optimize data visualization for better user experience.
