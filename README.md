# Climate and Vegetation Data Interface & Prediction Model

This project, developed for the **900M association**, aims to create an interface providing climate and vegetation data while identifying correlations between them. Additionally, it includes a predictive model designed to simulate soil moisture evolution following rainfall events for different locations.

## Project Structure

- `Interface/` : Contains the application displaying different kind of data.
- `prediction_model/` : Houses the predictive algorithms that analyze data and forecast soil moisture changes after rainfall episodes. These models are intended to be integrated into the graphical interface in the future.

## Future Developments

- Enhance prediction accuracy by refining the models.
- Generalize the model to different areas
- Establish a seamless connection between the predictive algorithms and the GUI.
- Optimize data visualization for better user experience.
